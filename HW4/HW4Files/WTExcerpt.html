<h3>ACT 1 Scene 1 </h3>
<h4>Enter Camillo and Archidamus <h4>
<h2>ARCHIDAMUS</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 If 
 you 
 shall 
 chance 
,
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Camillo 
,
 to 
 visit 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Bohemia 
 on 
 the 
 like 
 occasion 
 whereon 
 my 
 services 
 are 
 now 
 on 
 foot 
,
 you 
 shall 
 see 
,
 as 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 I 
 have 
 said 
,
 great 
 difference 
 betwixt 
 our 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Bohemia 
 and 
 your 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Sicilia 
.
<h2>CAMILLO</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 I 
 think 
 this 
 coming 
 summer 
 the 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 King 
 of 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Sicilia 
 means 
 to 
 pay 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Bohemia 
 the 
 visitation 
 which 
 he 
 justly 
 owes 
 him 
.
<h2>ARCHIDAMUS</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Wherein 
 our 
 entertainment 
 shall 
 shame 
 us 
;
 we 
 will 
 be 
 justified 
 in 
 our 
 loves 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 For 
 indeed 
<h2>CAMILLO</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Beseech 
 you 
<h2>ARCHIDAMUS</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Verily 
,
</p>
<br>
<p>
 I 
 speak 
 it 
 in 
 the 
 freedom 
 of 
 my 
 knowledge 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 We 
 cannot 
 with 
 such 
 magnificence 
 in 
 so 
 rare 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 I 
 know 
 not 
 what 
 to 
 say 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 We 
 will 
 give 
 you 
 sleepy 
 drinks 
,
 that 
 your 
 senses 
,
 unintelligent 
 of 
 our 
 insufficience 
,
 may 
,
 though 
 they 
 cannot 
 praise 
 us 
,
 as 
 little 
 accuse
 us 
.
<h2>CAMILLO</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 You 
 pay 
 a 
 great 
 deal 
 too 
 dear 
 for 
 what’s 
 given 
 freely 
.
<h2>ARCHIDAMUS</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Believe
 me 
,
</p>
<br>
<p>
 I 
 speak 
 as 
 my 
 understanding 
 instructs 
 me 
 and 
 as 
 mine 
 honesty 
 puts 
 it 
 to 
 utterance 
.
<h2>CAMILLO</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Sicilia 
 cannot 
 show 
 himself 
 overkind 
 to 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Bohemia 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 They 
 were 
 trained 
 together 
 in 
 their 
 childhoods 
,
 and 
 there 
 rooted 
 betwixt 
 them 
 then 
 such 
 an 
<h3>ACT1.SC.2</h3>
 affection 
 which 
 cannot 
 choose 
 but 
 branch 
 now 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Since 
 their 
 more 
 mature 
 dignities 
 and 
 royal 
 necessities 
 made 
 separation 
 of 
 their 
 society 
,
 their 
 encounters 
,
 though 
 not 
 personal 
,
 hath 
 been 
 royally 
 attorneyed 
 with 
 interchange 
 of 
 gifts 
,
 letters 
,
 loving 
 embassies 
,
 that 
 they 
 have 
 seemed 
 to 
 be 
 together 
 though 
 absent 
,
 shook 
 hands 
 as 
 over 
 a 
 vast 
,
 and 
 embraced 
 as 
 it 
 were 
 from 
 the 
 ends 
 of 
 opposed 
 winds 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 The 
 heavens 
 continue 
 their 
 loves 
.
<h2>ARCHIDAMUS</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 I 
 think 
 there 
 is 
 not 
 in 
 the 
 world 
 either 
 malice 
 or 
 matter 
 to 
 alter 
 it 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 You 
 have 
 an 
 unspeakable 
 comfort 
 of 
 your 
 young 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Prince 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Mamillius 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 It 
 is 
 a 
 gentleman 
 of 
 the 
 greatest 
 promise 
 that 
 ever 
 came 
 into 
 my 
 note 
.
<h2>CAMILLO</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 I 
 very 
 well 
 agree 
 with 
 you 
 in 
 the 
 hopes 
 of 
 him 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 It 
 is 
 a 
 gallant 
 child 
 one 
 that 
 indeed 
 physics 
 the 
 subject 
,
 makes 
 old 
 hearts 
 fresh 
.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 They 
 that 
 went 
 on 
 crutches 
 ere 
 he 
 was 
 born 
 desire 
 yet 
 their 
 life 
 to 
 see 
 him 
 a 
 man 
.
<h2>ARCHIDAMUS</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Would 
 they 
 else 
 be 
 content 
 to 
 die 
?
<h2>CAMILLO</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Yes 
,
 if 
 there 
 were 
 no 
 other 
 excuse 
 why 
 they 
 should 
 desire 
 to 
 live 
.
<h2>ARCHIDAMUS</h2>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 If 
 the 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 King 
 had 
 no 
 son 
,
 they 
 would 
 desire 
 to 
 live 
 on 
 crutches 
 till 
 he 
 had 
 one 
.

 that’s

<p>
 I 
 am 
 questioned 
 by 
 my 
 fears 
 of 
 what

<br>
<p>
 Or 
 breed 
 upon
